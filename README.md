UCSDUnfoldingMaps
=================

> Eclipse Project using Processing and Unfolding Maps for UCSD/Coursera Object Oriented Programming in Java.

A very basic Unfolding demo you'll find in the source folder in the default package. 
For more examples visit http://unfoldingmaps.org, or download the template with
examples.

The module folders contain the starter code for the programming assignments
associated with the MOOC.

Get excited and make things!


Installation
------------

Import this folder in Eclipse ('File' -> 'Import' -> 'Existing Projects into
Workspace', Select this folder, 'Finish')  
  
If things don't work, try ('Project' -> 'Clean') before running.


Manual Installation
-------------------

If the import does not work follow the steps below.

- Create new Java project
- Copy+Paste all files into project
- Add all lib/*.jars to build path
- Set native library location for jogl.jar. Choose appropriate folder for your OS.
- Add data/ as src


Troubleshooting
---------------

Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with Java 1.6, and 1.7)
